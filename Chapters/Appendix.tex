\subsection{Handover Requirements}
\label{Handover Requirements}

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A1: The adding of patients to the ward list is automatic and will be undertaken by the admission system (this is out of scope)
\item A2: Handover should be done by exception rather than the rule, this means that the handover should focus on variances
\item A3: Resuscitation is not part of the clinical handover
\item A4: We can make up data such as Doctor Names, etc
\item A5: We can use abbreviations if they are standard abbreviations
\item A6: In regards to the Discharge Plan, we can simply put the Discharge Destination and assume that all relevant information resides in another system that we are linking to
\item A7: In regards to test results, we can assume that we are linking to a different system where all the relevant data is present and we merely have to show the status of the test
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Business Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item B1: Increase efficiency in conducting Clinical Handovers by reducing human errors
\item B2: Increase productivity in conducting Clinical Handovers by reducing time in accessing patient information
\item B3: Reduce redundancy in delivering Clinical Handover information for the staff on the next shift
\item B4: Reduce time in doing handovers by providing nurses, doctors and allied health access to an electronic copy of patient’s information
\item B5: Create a uniform handover for clinical staff 
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\textbf{Stakeholder Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item S1: A user must be able to access patient information of any patient on the ward
\item S2: A user must see the critical patient information first when accessing that patient's information in the system
\item S3: The status of the patient in terms of current location, procedure or activity should be accessible by the user
\item S4: A user has to be informed of changes in the patient's information for:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item test results
	\item variances in observations
	\item change of medicine whether in dose or type
	\item change in patient treatment

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Any tubes, lines, drains

\subsection{SANSURGIMS Data Flow}
\label{SANSURGIMS Data Flow}

Data flow within SANSURGIMS is quite simple. The data entry forms are all used to supply the handover form with data. The only forms in SANSURGIMS that do not feed information into the handover form are the General Patient Information Form, the Tracking List Form and various table forms. These tables forms are used merely for listing all instances of the data entry forms. They do not contribute any data or information themselves. Figure \ref{Data Flow} shows how all data flows from the data entry forms to the handover.

\begin{figure}[hp]

\newpage
\subsection{SANSURGIMS Work Flow}
\label{SANSURGIMS Work Flow}
The following sections outline workflows within SANSURGIMS based on forms.

\subsubsection{Handover}
The user starts on the ward tracking list and proceeds to select a patient handover by clicking on the ``Handover" button in the row that corresponds to that patient. The user will be shown the handover form and if the user requires, he or she can obtain more information by navigating to specific clinical forms through the button menu at the bottom of the page. The user returns to the handover form by clicking on the ``Done" button on the clinical form page. When the user has all of the information he or she needs, they return to the tracking list via the ``Tracking List" button.

				\includegraphics[scale=1.0, width=123mm]{Images/Handover-Workflow}
				\caption{Handover Workflow within SANSURGIMS}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection{General Patient Information}
The user starts on the ward tracking list and proceeds to select a patient's general information by clicking on the ``i" button in the row that corresponds to that patient. The user will be shown the patient's general information and is able to edit this information to reflect updates to the patient. Once finished, the user returns to the ward tracking list by clicking on the ``Done" button.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Data Entry}
The user starts on the ward tracking list and proceeds to select a patient's handover by clicking on the ``Handover" button in the row that corresponds to that patient. The user will be shown the handover form and can find buttons to various clinical forms at the bottom of the form. By clicking on the button corresponding to the form the user requires, he or she will be transferred to that form in order to enter information pertaining to the patient. Once the user is finished entering data, the user saves and return to the handover form by clicking on the ``Done" button. The user can proceed to another clinical form or finish his or her work by clicking on the ``Tracking List" button to return to the ward tracking list.
