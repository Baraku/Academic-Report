\subsection{Handover Requirements}
\label{Handover Requirements}

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A1: The adding of patients to the ward list is automatic and will be undertaken by the admission system (this is out of scope)
\item A2: Handover should be done by exception rather than the rule, this means that the handover should focus on variances
\item A3: Resuscitation is not part of the clinical handover
\item A4: We can make up data such as Doctor Names, etc
\item A5: We can use abbreviations if they are standard abbreviations
\item A6: In regards to the Discharge Plan, we can simply put the Discharge Destination and assume that all relevant information resides in another system that we are linking to
\item A7: In regards to test results, we can assume that we are linking to a different system where all the relevant data is present and we merely have to show the status of the test
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Business Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item B1: Increase efficiency in conducting Clinical Handovers by reducing human errors
\item B2: Increase productivity in conducting Clinical Handovers by reducing time in accessing patient information
\item B3: Reduce redundancy in delivering Clinical Handover information for the staff on the next shift
\item B4: Reduce time in doing handovers by providing nurses, doctors and allied health access to an electronic copy of patient’s information
\item B5: Create a uniform handover for clinical staff 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stakeholder Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item S1: A user must be able to access patient information of any patient on the ward

\item S9: Nurses and Doctors must be able to view a complete list of patients on a ward
\item S10: Nurses and Doctors must be made aware of variance incidents of prior shift
\item S11: The end users care about color so the forms need to be pleasing to the eye
\item S12: In terms of handover, the nurses want to know the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Any tubes, lines, drains
	\item The rate of the IV (ml/hour)
	\item If the patient has voided or not
	\item If the patient has a catheter or not and whether the catheter has been removed
